### ‚úÖ Updated

- **Unified image handling with `XFile`**:
    - Removed usage of `Uint8List` for `ImagePicker` output.
    - `AppImagePicker`, `FullScreenImageViewer`, and related utilities now use `XFile` exclusively.
- Refactored `AppImageResolver` and `appImageProvider()` to support all platforms via `XFile`.
- Optimized widget structure to avoid duplicate storage of file and byte state.

### üõ†Ô∏è Refactored

- Removed legacy memory-based `Uint8List` image handling in favor of cleaner, async-free `XFile`-based rendering.
- Ensured full support for web and native platforms using `Image.network()` and `FileImage()` as needed.
