### 0.0.9 ‚Äì Jul 12, 2025

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Refactored

- **Removed** all image_picker-related logic from the package.
- **Replaced** any direct dependency on `image_picker` with `XFile? pickedFile` from `cross_file`, ensuring full cross-platform compatibility.

### ‚ú® Added

- `pickedFile` property to `AppImageViewer` and `ImageBuilder` to support dynamic rendering of images picked outside this package.
- Updated `AppImageResolver` to cleanly support rendering images from:
  - `XFile` on Web and Mobile
  - Network (via `CachedNetworkImage`)
  - Asset images
- More flexible handling of UI display scenarios.

### üì¶ Dependencies

- **Added:** `cross_file` for platform-agnostic `XFile` support.
- **Retained:** `cached_network_image` for optimized network image loading.
